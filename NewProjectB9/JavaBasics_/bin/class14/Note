Methods in Java:
Method in Java is a BLOCK of code that perform some specific operTions;
when we call a method, all the statements are executed inside the method, 
then the control of the program jumps back to the point where that method
 was called and it executed the next available instruction;

 on a very high level we can divide methods in two types:
 
 -Built-in methods - can not change them
 -User defined methods
